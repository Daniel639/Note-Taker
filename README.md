# Note-Taker

The note-taking application offers a user-friendly interface with a landing page directing users to their notes. The notes page displays a list of existing notes in the left column and provides empty fields for creating new notes in the right column. Upon entering a new note's title and text, "Save Note" and "Clear Form" buttons appear in the navigation bar.Saving a new note adds it to the list of existing notes in the left column. Clicking on an existing note displays its content in the right column and activates a "New Note" button in the navigation, facilitating quick creation of new notes. This intuitive design streamlines the note-taking process, making it easy for users to organize and access their notes.
